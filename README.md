# Stereolabs ZED - UE4 Samples

This repository contains Unreal sample projects that demonstrate how to create advanced Mixed Reality application using the ZED SDK and Unreal.

## How to use it ?

First you need to have our custom engine installed and ready to use (otherwise you can follow our [installation guide](https://docs.stereolabs.com/mixed-reality/unreal/getting-started/)).

Then you can follow these steps:
- Download this repository.
- Go to your new root project folder. Create a new folder called **Plugins**.
- Drop the Stereolabs folder within the plugin download into this folder. If you havenâ€™t downloaded the plugin yet, you can get it [here](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-unreal-plugin).
- Right click on the *ZEDSamples.uproject*, select *switch Unreal Engine version...* and choose our custom engine you previously installed in the list.
- Open the *ZEDSamples.sln* new file with Visual Studio 2015.
- Build the solution by pressing **Ctrl + F5**. Once the build is done, it will start the project in the UE4 Editor.

You can now start the project with a double click on *ZEDSamples.uproject*.

## Inside the Editor

You can find several maps in content. Each map show you how to use the plugin for a specific use. Don't hesitate to try them all !

We have more documentation available on [lights and shadows](https://docs.stereolabs.com/mixed-reality/unreal/lighting/) or on [spatial mapping](https://docs.stereolabs.com/mixed-reality/unreal/spatial-mapping/) if you are interested in.
